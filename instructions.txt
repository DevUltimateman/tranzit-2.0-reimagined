Tranzit 2.0 Reimagined trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNidBIvSqaI

INSTRUCTIONS: 

1. Head over to to your Black Ops 2 Root Folder ( Root folder == where your black ops 2 files are )

2. If you don't see a folder called t6r in there, create one. You can skip this step if you already have a folder called t6r in your Black Ops 2 root folder

3. Drag the downloaded data.zip file inside your t6r folder

4. Right click on the data.zip package and choose the option called "Extract Here"

5. Once its done extracting open then the folder called "data"

6. You should now see a folder called maps & another zip file called images.zip

7. Right click on the images.zip and choose "Extract Here" again

8. Once its done extracting you should be done


Something to keep in mind...
The textures will override default textures forever until you rename the images folder to something else. 
Renaming the images folder to something else is highly recommended if you play other maps often and not Tranzit since some maps use some of the textures from Tranzit.
